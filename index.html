<h3>So... I desperately need to update this site</h3>
I haven't updated this since I started M7 Unlimited back in 2017, and I clearly never finished it. A lot has changed has changed since then. As of this update it's now June 2023 and I am working on some new ideas.

<h3>Posts</h1>

<ul class="post-links">
{% for post in site.posts %}
	<li><a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">{{ post.title | escape }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<h3>Talks</h3>
