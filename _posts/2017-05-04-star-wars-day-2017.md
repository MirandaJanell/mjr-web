May the Fourth be with you!

I needed a post for testing purposes, and what better way to start things off than by celebrating Star Wars! Unfortunately for this post, I'm focused on site design rather than writing, so I'm going to keep it pretty short. Today was a pretty good day. It started off with [Nrrd Grl](https://wiseami.com), the Nrrdlets, and I celebrating Star Wars Day during breakfast. It's been a pretty steady stream of geeking out with fellow fans all day.
